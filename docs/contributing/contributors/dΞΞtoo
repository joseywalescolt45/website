## About

I'm a technology and intellectual property attorney with more than a decade of experience working at international law firms and in-house.  I specialize in negotiating and drafting all sorts of technology agreements and licenses.  

*Fun fact:* I've never had a bowl of cereal.  I think it's weird to pour milk into a bowl.

### Team contributions

Drafting all of the legal disclaimers and licenses for Arrow development.  Helping create the Arrow non-profit entity in Wyoming.  Helping manage the contributor compensation and governance vesting.

### Main skills

All things legal related.

## Please involve me!

If you every have any questions about intellectual property or licensing of Arrow products or services, let me know.  Please also loop me in for any regulatory questions or concerns as well.  Thanks!
